# 📘 SwiftUI-Concepts-Tutorials-Apple

This repository contains my personal notes, exercises, and project implementations as I follow Apple's official [SwiftUI Concepts tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui-concepts).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to deepen my understanding of SwiftUI by exploring the fundamental building blocks presented in Apple's tutorial. Key concepts include: 

- Declarative UI
- Data flow with `@State`, `@Binding`, `@Environment`, etc.
- Layouts and adaptive design
- Navigation and transitions
- Animations
- UIKit interoperability
- Accessibility best practices
- Previews and testing
- Scalable and modular UI architecture

## 🗂 Repository Structure

Each subfolder represents a section, concept, or mini-project covered throughout the tutorial.

Each folder typically includes:

- Xcode project and Swift source files
- Notes or reference material (when relevant)

🏞 Landmarks Project

The `Landmarks` folder contains the first complete project from Apple’s SwiftUI Concepts tutorial. It introduces:

- Declarative layout with stacks
- Reusable components
- Real-time previews
- MapKit integration
- Dynamic lists generated from data with List and ForEach
- Identifiable model structures for seamless list rendering
- Hierarchical navigation using NavigationView and NavigationLink
- Multiple previews to test layouts on different devices and orientations
- Data flow and state management with @State, @Binding, @Observable, and @Environment
- A shared ModelData object as single source of truth, enabling user interactions (like marking favorites) to automatically update across views

This project starts with a static landmark detail screen and evolves into a data-driven list with navigation, demonstrating how SwiftUI combines views, data, and navigation in a scalable way.
